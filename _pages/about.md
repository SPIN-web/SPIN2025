# About SPIN

The SPIN symposium started off as a workshop themed around the [SPIN model checker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPIN_model_checker) in 1995.
Since then it has been an established forum for model checking and program analysis.

You can find statistics about and links to past SPIN events [here](https://spinroot.com/spin/Workshops/). Proceedings of previous years are available via [Springer](https://link.springer.com/conference/spin).
