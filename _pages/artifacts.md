# Artifact Evaluation

For the second time, SPIN 2025 features artifact evaluation (AE).
For all accepted SPIN papers, authors are able to submit an artifact to substantiate the claims made in the paper.
Participation in the AE is optional, but strongly encouraged.
The outcome of the voluntary artifact evaluation will not alter the paper acceptance decision, but a positive outcome increases its credibility.


## Artifact
An artifact is any additional material (software, data sets, machine-checkable proofs, etc.) that substantiates claims made in the paper and ideally renders them fully replicable.
For example, an artifact might consist of a tool and its documentation, input files used for tool evaluation in the paper, and configuration files or documents describing parameters used in the experiments.

## Evaluation Criteria
The Artifact Evaluation Committee (AEC) will read the corresponding paper and evaluate the artifact according to the following criteria:

- consistency with and replicability of results presented in the paper
- completeness
- documentation and ease of use
- availability in a permanent online repository.

The evaluation will be based on the [EAPLS guidelines](https://eapls.org/pages/artifact_badges/), and the AEC will decide which of the badges — among Functional, Reusable, and Available — will be assigned to a given artifact.
The corresponding badges can be added to the title page of the paper in case of acceptance.

# Submission guidelines

Artifacts should be submitted via the EasyChair SPIN 2025 submission website:
[https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=spin2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=spin2025) in the track *Artifacts*.

Detailed submission guidelines will be posted at a later date.
