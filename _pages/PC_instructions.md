## Confidentiality

Papers under consideration for publication should not be distributed or disclosed to any individual, except with the explicit authorization of the chairs for the purpose of review.

## PC Responsibilities

You are expected to personally read all your assigned papers and write your own reviews. In case you would like to use subreviewers for such papers, we trust that you are certain that your close collaborators have no conflict of interest with the paper. Yet, in case of doubt and/or other subreviewers, please contact us (PC chairs) before issuing subreviewing requests on EasyChair.
Review Expectations
Please write detailed and constructive reviews.  Our goal as a Programme Committee is to provide useful feedback that authors can use to improve their paper even if it is rejected. Remember that authors have invested considerable time and effort in their submissions, so please treat them with respect even when criticizing. Look for the positive in every paper. Resist the impulse to use demeaning language or sarcasm in your reviews. Please instead frame your reviews from the viewpoint of looking for reasons to accept each paper and providing the feedback needed to make the best publication out of this paper.

## Review Structure

We suggest to structure the review as follows

*Summary*: A brief summary of the paper, methods, and contributions. Please aim to formulate this in your own words, to reflect your understanding of the paper's content.

*Strengths/Reasons to accept*:
- List the main strengths and/or reasons why you think this paper should be accepted

*Weaknesses/Reasons to reject*:
- similarly, summarize your concerns briefly
- please clarify what you mean in the detailed comments section

Include a summary of your assessment here.

*Detailed Comments*: Please substantiate your assessment here, in particular if you have concerns. Please keep in mind to be constructive, include also what you liked about the paper, and offer suggestions on how to improve the presentation.
